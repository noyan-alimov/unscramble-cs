Task 0:
The Big O Notation is O(1)
In terms of space, the code created two variables.

Task 1:
There are 2 for loops in total. The Big O in this case is O(n).
The best, average and worst case scenarios do not differ really. The for loops have to go through each number to append them to the array.

Task 2:
There are 6 for loops. The Big O is O(n).

Task 3:
Part A:
Big O is O(log n). There are 3 for loops. In terms of space, one variable is created to store a set.

Part B:
Big O is O(log n).

Task 4:
Big O is O(log n). 5 for loops and two variables are created to store one object and one set.
